    <!-- strat of work around dive for IE -->
    <p>IE Work Around:Neither IE nor Edge support the min-content and max-content attributes, as of this writing.
        However, <b> there is a workaround using the custom -ms-grid</b> attribute. <u> You have to <mark>first
                place the container inside another parent element </mark>(grandparent, actually) and then apply the
            properties to the grandparent</u>. So the HTML will look like this:</p>

    <div class="grandParent">
        <!-- Note the "grandParent" class is being used for the styling of IE or Edge browser. The the child with "contentBasedWidth" for other  -->
        <div class="contentBasedWidth">container
            <div>Fourscore and 20 years ago,</div>
            <div>our fathers brought forth to this continent</div>
